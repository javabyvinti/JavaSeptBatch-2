      Student is a Person

eg--> Rohan has a Loan(Edu, personal, home, etc) --> class and object
      Aman has a Laptop(Brand, )	


Inheritance --> when we want to reuse the code
		no of features to use are more then always apply inheritance

Class and Object --> requirement of predefined code is based upon usage




Inheritance

root --> child or nodes or derived class


base class --> derived class

--> features: 1) code reuseablity
	      2) no need to create object
	      3) polymorphism --> one way many forms
		Opeator overloading:
		eg--> 43 + 65 = 108
		eg--> "Hello" + "Ram" = Hello Ram

			--> method overloading
			--> method overriding
